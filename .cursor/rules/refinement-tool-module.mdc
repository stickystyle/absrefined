# Refinement Tool Module: Process Orchestration

The [chapter_refinement_tool.py](mdc:absrefined/refinement_tool/chapter_refinement_tool.py) module orchestrates the entire refinement process. Key responsibilities:

- Coordinates between the client, transcriber, and refiner components
- Manages the end-to-end workflow for chapter refinement
- Handles audio file downloading and caching
- Processes chapter markers in sequence
- Compares original and refined chapter positions
- Determines which changes are significant
- Manages the update process for the AudioBookShelf server
- Provides detailed reporting on refinement results

This is the highest-level component that integrates all other modules.
