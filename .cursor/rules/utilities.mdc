# Utilities Module: Support Functions

The [utils](mdc:absrefined/utils) package contains support functions used across the application:

- [timestamp.py](mdc:absrefined/utils/timestamp.py): Handles timestamp conversions and formatting
  - Converts between different timestamp formats (HH:MM:SS, seconds)
  - Formats timestamps for display and API interactions
  - Performs timestamp comparisons and calculations

These utilities ensure consistent timestamp handling throughout the application.
