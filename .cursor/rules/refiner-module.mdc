# Refiner Module: Chapter Marker Analysis

The [chapter_refiner.py](mdc:absrefined/refiner/chapter_refiner.py) module uses language models to analyze transcriptions and determine optimal chapter positions. Key features:

- Connects to OpenAI-compatible LLM APIs
- Analyzes audio transcription with context around chapter markers
- Assesses if the current chapter marker is accurate
- Determines more precise timestamp for chapter transitions when needed
- Provides confidence scores and reasoning for refinements

This module contains the core logic for identifying where chapter breaks should actually occur based on audio content.
