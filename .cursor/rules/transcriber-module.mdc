# Transcriber Module: Audio Transcription

The [audio_transcriber.py](mdc:absrefined/transcriber/audio_transcriber.py) module handles converting audio to text. Key features:

- Transcribes audio files using OpenAI's speech-to-text API
- Processes audio in segments to handle large files
- Provides detailed word-level timestamps
- Caches transcriptions to avoid redundant processing
- Handles various audio formats

The module is essential for creating precise text representations of audio segments around chapter markers, which are then analyzed by the refiner.
